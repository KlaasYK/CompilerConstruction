\section{Problem description}
The aim of this lab is to give a library to use with a compiler for a language with infinite precision integers.
Furthermore the following function must be defined:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Creating an integer from string
 \item Printing an integer to stdout
 \item Adding two integers
 \item Substracting two integers
 \item Multiplying two integers
 \item Dividing an integer by another integer
 \item Apply a modulo on an integer
 \item Apply a power to an integer
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem analysis}
First there must be a datastructure to define the Big integers.
A logical solution is to store each digit of the number in an array as integers in C are not infinite.
To keep track of the sign, another numeric variable can be used.
For exanple a -1 for negative integers and 1 for positive.
When using an array representation, a length too can be usefull, as C does provide a length function for integers.

\subsection{Multiplying}
There are multiple algorithms to choose from when multiplying.
The standard long multiplication algorithm which runs in $O(n)$.
As there can be a lot of mulitplications in a program, a lower order function is prefered.
An example discussed here is the karatsuba algorithm.

\section{Evaluation}
The performance of the algorithms used is adequate.
One thing that could be improved upon is the allocation of memory.
At runtime a lot of memory is allocated, reallocated and copied over.
Instead of keeping the digit arrays at the exact needed length, a function can be used to double the amount digits when needed.
Doubling the length of the array makes sure there are less memory allocations and the digit array is always large enough to contain all digits.
